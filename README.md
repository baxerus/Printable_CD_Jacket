# Printable CD Jacket
A CD/DVD jacket you can design and print out

This is a self contained HTML file (single file) that can be used locally in the browser (as `file:///...` without need for a webserver) or even simplier directly [here through the magic ðŸª„ of GitHub Pages](https://baxerus.github.io/Printable_CD_Jacket/).

You will need a [paper staple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_(fastener)#Paper_staples) and optionally a [hole punch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punch#ISO_838) if you want to add your CD to a binder or so.

## Compatibility
Developed and tested was this HTML file in (macOS) Google Chrome version 109 (more or less, versions increased while developing).  
It **may or may not work** in later versions of Chrome (likely) and/or other browsers (maybe).
